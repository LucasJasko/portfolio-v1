                The European Convention Center Luxembourg consists of two buildings dedicated to corporate and government events: the main building and the
                hemicycle. Every year, it hosts more than 400 events, all tailor-made and in an exceptional setting in the heart of Luxembourg's Kirchberg
                business district. It offers a wide range of services that customers don't have to worry about during their event: Cleaning, security, catering
                and a wide range of technical equipment. Three times a year, the ECCL hosts the European Council of Ministers, which fully privatizes the
                premises and incorporates its own security elements.

                As Event Assistant, I was in charge of supporting the work of Grégory, Event Manager at ECCL for almost 10 years. We took over from our sales
                colleagues as soon as the rental contract was signed by the customer. I was in charge of coordinating the various players involved in making a
                good event: technical, security, cleaning, catering, the direct customer and, very often, external service providers. I was also close to the
                customers, guiding them in their choice of services within the ECCL. I also worked on the event follow-up part, for which we produced the annual
                activity report with the rest of the team.

              <p class="eccl-card-back card-back">
                During this 6-month period, I discovered the world of business events. A facet of the events that I had never explored before. I learned to
                perfect my personal service and to become more demanding with myself to deliver quality work that meets customer expectations. It's an exercise
                that has given me a lot in terms of self-perception. Managing a 3,500 m² building and coordinating 5 to 6 different departments requires clarity
                and rigor in one's work in order to distribute information correctly.

            In July 2023, as my professional situation allowed, I decided to leave my native region to put an end to a 5-year long-distance relationship with my
            partner who lives in Thionville (Grand Est - France). After a period of job hunting in the region, I found my first position at ECCL. I'm very proud
            to have taken this step, as it perfectly reflects my state of mind from that moment on. It's a period of transition in my life, but above all a new
            beginning.

                At Alive, I have held two positions and they both taught me a lot. First, I was a stock manager in the lighting section of the equipment pool. I
                was in charge of equipment maintenance and organizing the departure and return of equipment. I then worked as a sales representative for Alive's
                broadcast division, which specializes in rental of equipment for filming. I was in close contact with Alive's "small" customers to offer them a
                tailor-made rental service that met their expectations.

                In both positions, priority has always been given to the quality of service and equipment offered to customers. I've rubbed shoulders with a lot
                of industry professionals, both internal and external. It was at Alive that I most developed my adaptability and organizational skills. These
                are essential qualities in an environment where everything has to be redone for each new project.

                event management business was at a low ebb and I was nearing the end of my studies. This opportunity came just before the Covid crisis, which
                completely paralyzed the events industry. So at the very least, I had this activity to make a bit of money.

                At Ikea, I was a sales assistant in the Tableware department. I was in charge of stocking the shelves, making sure they were properly maintained

                In the sound option, I discovered how to professionally produce a sound production, from its raw capture to its final mix. The main technical
                objective was to make the audio content as pure as possible, so as to offer an exceptional final rendering to the editor in charge of video
                assembly. We were also in charge of various audio manipulations on software in dedicated mixing rooms.

                This technological BAC is purely oriented towards sustainable development and its link with industrial professions. When I took this exam, there
                were 4 options: digital, eco-design, energy and architecture. It's a BAC that opens the door to many different sectors, thanks to its
                versatility and modernity. At my school, the classrooms were very well equipped for this kind of practice. For example, a 3D printer was
                available right in our classroom for designing our projects.

              <p class="bac-card-back card-back">
                I chose the ITEC option (Technological Innovation and Eco-design) in which I learned how to carry out a project by starting with an idea, then
                drawing up specifications, conceptualizing the project using 3D software and finally materializing the project using 3D printing. I learned how
                to defend a project in front of a panel of judges and highlight its strengths and advantages.

              <p class="bac-card-back card-back">
                After these studies, which I really enjoyed and learned a lot from, I decided to change direction and go into a sector that intrigued me:
                audiovisual. My father had worked in the events industry for a long time, so he was able to guide me in my choice of direction. I was convinced
                that I could only succeed in this field if I put all my passion and ambition into it.

        <h3>About my skills</h3>
        <p>
          For me, a well done job is always born of passion. I was able to experiment with many different working methods through my career, and this helped me
          understand which ones suited me best. As a self-taught person, I've been able to fuel my curiosity through research and thus develop a strong interest
          in programming. Despite my young experience, I know how to work efficiently and appropriately on a project, using all the tools at my disposal to
          deliver good quality content for both the customer and collaborators.

          Without this asset, I certainly wouldn't have put up with changing direction so regularly. I've often questioned my life paths, but I've never given
          in to stress or abandonment. I'm confident in myself and I know my limits, so I've always known how to act in different situations. I consider stress
          management to be the number one quality of a good collaborator.

          Sharing optimal informations avoids both making mistakes and missing an opportunity to optimize one's own work and that of others. I've worked a lot
          on my ability to make suggestions, particularly at Ikea, Alive and ECCL, where this aspect is a fundamental pillar of overall work balance.

        <p id="strength-3">
          Working with a wide variety of people has enabled me to develop good elocution, whether with customers or colleagues. This ability allows me to
          develop a feeling of trust and comfort with the person, thus multiplying the possibilities for dialogue. It goes without saying that respect for the
          client is a fundamental value of my relationship methods, whether in dialogue or interaction.
        </p>
        <p id="strength-4">
          I am very curious by nature and like to develop my knowledge of the subjects I study. As a result, I've naturally developed a keen sense of analysis
          and observation of the world around me. I think it's vital to apply this value to the workplace, as it enables me to stay alert and deliver quality
          work. I believe that the human brain needs to be stimulated by its five senses to work optimally.

          <p>
            I personally believe that there is a trinity in well-being, the various subjects of which do not function properly without each other: Sport,
            nutrition and sleep. Each of these three subjects has a variety of very interesting details, but they only reveal their true potential when applied
            together. Of course I remain flexible to life's events but I try to apply these principles to preserve my health and balance.

          <h3>CAM</h3>
          <p>
            I discovered computer-assisted music at the age of 17. I come from a Polish family for whom music is part of every meal. Singing, violins, accordion
            and double bass rocked my entire youth, and I owe them a great deal for instilling in me what is for me the primary interest of music: creating
            memories. CAM gave me the beginnings of my desire to build with my hands on digital technology. Composing is an escape that instantly reconnects me
            with my musical identity.

          <p>
            It's a passion that has been with me since childhood. I played my first game at the age of eight. It was Pokemon on Nintendo advance SP. I remember
            it like it was yesterday! And since then, I've always been able to find free time to devote to this escape. I've had several different consoles, but
            nowadays I mainly play on the computer, with a wide variety of game types and genres, such as RPGs (Role Play Games) and MMOs (Massively Multiplayer
            Online).
